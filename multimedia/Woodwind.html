    <p class="woodwindtext">The woodwind section is named this as all of the instruments within this family used to be made of wood, however now they can be made of wood, plastic or metal. They are all resemblant of tubes or pipes with holes, with a mouthpiece at the top.
                            These instruments are played by blowing air into the mouthpiece and using your fingers to change which holes are covered/uncovered, which changes the pitch. The instruments in this section include the clarinet (left picture),
                            flute (middle picture), piccolo, oboe, and bassoon (right picture). The clarinet, oboe, and bassoon all have reeds on their mouthpieces, which are thin pieces of wood.</p>


    <p class="woodwindtext"> Here is a sound clip of what the flute sounds like.</p>
