    <p class="intro2">A full-scale symphony orchestra has around 100 musicians, split between 4 different sections: strings, woodwind, brass, and percussion. The average standard of the musicians is grade 8 (the highest grade in music), and professional orchestras can be extremely competetive to get into.
                      However, there are many amateur and youth orchestras across the country which provide many more people with the chance of joining and experiencing what its like to be a musician in one.</p>
